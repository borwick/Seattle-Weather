# Seattle Weather app, for Pebble #

This is a silly weather app for Pebble. It looks up weather
and frames it in terms of how rainy it is. E.g. "normal" means
rainy.

To install this, get an API key for openweathermap.org.

This is basically a copy of the Pebble tutorial.

To build, copy this into a cloudpebble.com project.
